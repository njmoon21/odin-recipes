    <!-- Short Description -->
    <p>Fish and chips is a hot dish consisting of fried fish in batter, served with chips.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients - Fish</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>7 tbsp of AP Flour</li>
        <li>7 tbsp of Cornstarch</li>
        <li>1 tsp of Baking Powder</li>
        <li>Salt & Pepper</li>
        <li>1/3 cup of Cold Dark Beer</li>
        <li>1/3 Cup of Cold Sparkling Water</li>
        <li>4 thick white fish fillets (Ex. cod)</li>
        <li>Oil for Deep Frying</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Ingredients - Chips (Fries...)</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 lbs. of 1/2 inch-thick Sliced Peeled Potatoes</li>
        <li>Oil for Deep Frying</li>  
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Set aside 2 tablespoons of all-purpose flour. In a large, roomy bowl, mix the remaining 
            5 tablespoons all-purpose flour with 7 tablespoons cornstarch and 1 teaspoon baking powder. 
            Season lightly with a tiny pinch of fine salt and freshly ground black pepper.</li>

        <li>Using a fork to whisk continuously, add 1/3 cup cold dark beer and 1/3 cup cold sparkling 
            water to the flour mixture and continue mixing until you have a thick, smooth batter. Place 
            the batter in the fridge to rest for 30 minutes to 1 hour.</li>

        <li>Meanwhile, cut 2-pounds peeled potatoes into a little less than 1/2-inch-thick slices, 
            then slice these into 1/2-inch-wide sticks. Place the chips into a colander and rinse under 
            cold water.</li>

        <li>Heat about 3 inches of vegetable oil to 350 F in a deep-fryer or large, deep saucepan. Par-cook
            the chips a few handfuls at a time in the oil, about 2 minutes (do not brown them). Remove the 
            chips from the oil and drain on paper towels. Set aside.</li>

        <li>Meanwhile, lay 4 (7-ounce) thick, white fish fillets on a paper towel and pat dry. Season 
            lightly with a little salt.</li>

        <li>Heat about 3 inches of vegetable oil to 350 F in a deep-fryer or large, deep saucepan. Par-cook 
            the chips a few handfuls at a time in the oil, about 2 minutes (do not brown them). Remove the 
            chips from the oil and drain on paper towels. Set aside.</li>

        <li>Place the 2 tablespoons of reserved flour into a shallow bowl. Toss each fish fillet in the flour
            and shake off any excess.</li>

        <li>Dip into the batter, coating the entire fillet.</li>

        <li>Position a rack in the center of the oven and heat to 200 F. Line a rimmed baking sheet with paper 
            towels and set aside. Bring the oil temperature back to 350 F. Carefully lower each fillet into the
            hot oil. Fry until the batter is crisp and golden, turning the fillets occasionally with a large 
            slotted spoon, 6 to 8 minutes.</li>

        <li>Remove the fillets from the oil to the paper-towel-lined baking sheet. Sprinkle lightly with salt 
            and transfer to the oven to keep warm.</li>
    
        <li>Heat the oil to 400 F, then cook the chips in batches until golden and crisp, about 5 minutes. 
            Remove from the oil and drain. Season with salt.</li>
    
    </ol>
